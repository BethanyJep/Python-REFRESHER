person = {'john':40, 'peter':45} 
print(person[susan])
# c) Since “susan” is not a key in the set, Python raises a KeyError exception
#Output will be undefined as Susan is not part of the tuple components

#Question 2: loops
#Create a while loop to print from 1980 to 2020
year = 1980
while year <= 2020:
    print(year)
    year += 1
# Create a for loop to print from -20 to +20
for num in range(-20, 21):
    print(num)
